<h2>Language switching and Final OS for netbook?</h2>
<div style="font-size: 15px;">Hello Ladies and gentlemans, As you can see from now on I will be making posts in english and I am working on changing the language of the whole website to english of course.
<br>Also I am really sorry that my last post was sutch a garbage I'll try to make posts more readeble.
<br>Just for you to know I'll be translating my old posts to english while keeping the original as comment inside the file.
<br>That's enough on webside updates.
<br>
<br>I NOOKED my Windows 10 partition on my netbook while installing MS-DOS "on sdcard" actully I installed it on the HDD :(
<br>After crying over my Diablo 2 SAVEGAME I actually got dos on the sdcard It's FreeDOS and It runs games and software just fine
<br>Also I go Windows 3.1 on it Runs fine with some basic games but cause of a lack of drivers(same in DOS) no sound and MSOFFICE is saing I have not enough RAM (I haven't fixed that yet)
<br>But that is not the main OS for this netbook with no network and sound xD Just a second OS on sdcard booting from sdcard reader
<br>But I choosed a main OS for this Netbook too. It's Linux of course. Lubuntu to be exact I got almost everything working in it and It's really fast and I am just keeping is as a main os :3
<br>
<br> That's it for todays post KoleckOLP signing out ;)
