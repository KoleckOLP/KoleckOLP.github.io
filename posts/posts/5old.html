<h2>Dream come true?</h2>
<div style="font-size: 15px;">On 24th of November I got and early Chrismass gift wich made me so happy. It was a 4:3 monitor, YES I said 4:3 monitor it's exactly what I wanted.
<br>Year ago I got a motherbord from my friend at school. She was one day like: "Man I found a pc do you want is?" and I was like YEA why not. and next they she carried a bag she gave the bag to me inside there was just a motherboard with RAM, CPU cooler but no GPU.
<br>The MOBO lied in my closet for a year now I got GPU for it but I wasn't abe to get into it's bios on my TV i needed a monitor. But why 4:3? Cause retro dude the board is old stuff.
<br>So finally I got everything I needed, I had to take the powersuply and DVD drive from my P4Bench so P4 is out of order for now.
<br>I always wanted to have a PC witch runs Windows 9x with sound and Internet and it worked I got everything working on that Mobo, Windows 98 Second Edition everything was smooth and fine until I started to play with intenet browsers and Kernelex. I killed the os I broke the kernel somehow. :(
<br>
<br>But after some crying I have reinstalled the OS and now it's back again my games are back and now I installed some more stuff. I liked Windows 98 Second Edition in virtual machine but on real hardware it get's slow and I am allways scared it will die again.
<br>SO is this a sucess? Yes it is I love that computer You can check it's specs in My devices on the right side. And there is a pick of the setup aswell. :)
<br>If you know some great W9x game don't be scared to send me an email contact@koleckolp.comli.com
