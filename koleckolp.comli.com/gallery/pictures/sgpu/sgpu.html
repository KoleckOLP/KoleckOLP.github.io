<p>Where are the good time where Graphics Cards use to look so pretty, I mean a sexy woman makes a graphics card look better 100%.<br> I was shocked to find that there are no pages dedicated to sexy women on GPU coollers, so I had to make one.<br> If you
    know a page full of cards like this please text me on discord (my server link is in every page footer)</p>
