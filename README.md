This is my stupid webpage.

I had plans like posting posts or something to it, but edditing it is a pain and it the nad I used it as a DB but even for that purpise it's kinda bad.<br>
This page needs a rework to make a work like a proper db.

The main issue is that I really don't want to be rewriting the whole thing.<br>
And right now I don't even have a local php server at ready, I pretty much can't work on it.<br>
The whole setup needed for me to be able to work on it is a pain in the ass.
